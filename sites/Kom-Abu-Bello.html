	  <h4>Ashley Start</h4>
         <h3>Introduction</h3>
		 <hr><!--this draws a line across the page, which I put under each section heading in the example-->
		 <p>Kom Abu Bello, a small village on the western edge of the Nile Delta, used to be known by the name of Mefket, the ancient Egyptian word for turquoise as well as the goddess Hathor, during pharaonic times. In Coptic, the site was known as Terenouti. Since the site has been excavated over the course of a century, there is not much left to it today. From 1969 to 1974 is when the most of the excavation took place. During the Coptic and Graeco-Roman periods, this site was one of the richest in Egypt, being an important major hub of trade in wine and salt for the Wadi. This site led to a better understanding of tomb burials during the Old, Middle, and New Kingdoms. The site of Kom Abu Bello, with its large cemetery and temples shows archaeologists how the ancient Egyptians during the beginning of the Coptic era practiced burials and worship and the evidence of how the village functioned with its many inhabitants with differing roles shows how daily life for ancient Egyptians during this period functioned and how it relates to other sites around it.</p>

	  <h3>Introduction to Location</h3>
	  <hr>
	  <p>The site is located on the western edge of the Nile Delta, about 70 km northwest of Cairo. Where the Wadi el-Natrun meets the Rosetta branch of the Nile is where exactly the site is situated. It is also in between two other historic sites, with Merimde Beni-salame to the south and Kom el-Hisn to the north. The name of the site itself is specific, referring to the northwest corner of the site. It is in this spot in the site where the site itself got its current name, Kom Abu Bello, as there is a Graeco-Roman cemetery located in the northwest corner of this site. Unfortunately, about a fourth of the cemetery site has been encroached by the village of Nasr Moustafa.</p>
	<br>
	<h3>Description of the Site</h3>
	<hr>
	<p>The site of Kom Abu Bello mostly consists of cemeteries with mudbrick tombs as well as a cemetery dedicated only for cattle, however, the modern village of Tarana has encroached upon major parts of the ancient site and these parts cannot be excavated because of it. Besides the cemeteries, the site also contains temples, one for Hathor and one for Apollo, although the temples have been mostly destroyed and only parts of the temples have been recovered. There is also evidence of trading of wine and salt in the site to areas in the surrounding area.</p>
	<br>
	<h3>Excavations</h3>
	<hr>
	<p>Most of the site consists of cemeteries, the majority of those being Old Kingdom tombs. The site is also mostly covered by a cemetery of Graeco-Roman origin with the coffins of that cemetery being made of ceramic with large faces that are typical of the Graeco-Roman period. North of the Middle Kingdom cemetery laid the remains of the temple of Apollo and to the west is the “Tomb of the Ruler.” The temple of Apollo was discovered at the northern edge of the site, however, the temple had been completely destroyed and it was impossible to trace the foundation of the temple. South of the Apollo temple, two limestone pieces with an inscription of the name Psamtik II on them were also found. Even further south from this discovery, two Roman baths were discovered as well as the well the water for the baths was acquired. This shows that the Romans were actively living in this area. Rectangular or square mudbrick tombs with a barrel-vaulted roof were also found in the cemetery, some of them having superstructures shaped like a pyramid and most of the tombs rest of platforms that are also made of mudbrick. “Terenuthis stelae” were found inside of the tomb niches, which were stelae depicting the dead buried inside the tomb. Over the course of the excavation of the site, over 450 stelae dating from between the second and fourth centuries AD were found inside these tombs. Most commonly, these stelae consisted of a person, most likely the deceased, standing between two Egyptian columns with Greek pediments and below the depiction is text in either Greek or demotic Egyptian. One stela depicts a party for the dead with music, which was a common occurrence during the time. Many of the deceased were buried with offerings at the time of their burials. These offerings were placed on offering tables inside of the tombs and consisted of grapes, lettuce, and wine. Found inside the tombs were also lamps with olive branches, fish, and the goddesses Heket and Serapis impressed on them lit for the dead at the time of the burial. Based on the excavations, it can be inferred that the most common occupations in the village were hunting and fishing, although there were also potters, vintners, jewelers, and artisans also located in the village. Artisans were also in the village who created the funerary stelae. Because of the frequency of wine and salt being among the personal artifacts in the tombs, it can also be inferred that there was active trading of wine and salt occurring in the village. There were not only human cemeteries found in the site, but also a cattle cemetery associated with the cult of Hathor located in the site as well. The temple of Hathor, dating to the reign of Ptolemy I Soter was destroyed, however, blocks from the temple were recovered. Anubis, Isis, Taweret, and Bes statues made of faience and containing hieroglyphics have been recovered at the site as well, which are indicative of the beliefs of the villagers at this site. Greek deities and goddesses are also represented at this site with statuettes located in some of the tombs. Many other types of personal artifacts were also found in the tombs, including a large amount of pottery painted in different colors from the end of the pharaonic period through the Coptic period, hair clips, ivory combs, amulets, bracelets, necklaces, gold earrings, and rings made of gold and silver. Because of the encroachment of the modern city of Tarana and cultivation surrounding the site as well, a large section of the site has been covered and cannot be excavated though mudbrick walls and potsherds from the ancient site have been found in the area.</p>

	<h3>Significance of Excavations</h3>
	<hr>
	<p>The excavations of Kom Abu Bello have been a very important contribution to ancient Egyptian archaeology. These excavations have made it possible to reconstruct the history of the transition period from pharaonic times into the Coptic era. They have also made it possible to further understand the culture of the period, especially with discovering the stelae in the tombs and also the religion of the people of the time with the recovery of parts of the temples. Discovering how the people of the time traded wine and salt with the nearby areas also helped to reconstruct the social relations of the period. These excavations also showed how the Romans interacted with the Egyptians during this period with the discovery of the Roman temple as well as the Roman baths, which show that the Romans spend everyday life in this site long ago.</p>
	<br>
	<h3>Conclusion</h3>
	<hr>
	<p>Kom Abu Bello, though much of it is lost because of the encroachment of a modern city, is a very important part of understanding ancient Egyptian life. The tombs in the cemetery discovered have helped archaeologists understand the funerary practices of the time as well as the type of funerals held for the dead and their beliefs relating to sending off the dead to the afterlife. The temples recovered at the site also show the religious beliefs of the ancient Egyptians living at the site during the transition into the Coptic era and what deities they worshipped and what they found most important in their religious beliefs. The excavations done of the site also help to give archaeologists a better understanding of how trade occurred at the time with the site being a major center for trade of wine and salt to other neighboring areas. This site fits into overall Egyptian archaeology by helping archaeologists further understand what ancient Egyptian life was like during the change from the pharaonic period to the Coptic era and how those changes were reflected in the archaeology of the site. Since this site was discovered near other archaeological sites, archaeologists were able to also further understand how the sites relate to each other and the relationship between villages during this time period and how they traded and otherwise interacted with each other. This site, with its many excavations of burial sites and places of worship for the ancient Egyptians has proven to be very important in understanding how daily life, including funerary practices and religion, functioned for ancient Egyptians during the important transition point from the pharaonic period to the Coptic era, a crucial transition point in ancient Egyptian history. Had this site not been discovered and excavated for as long as it had been, Egyptian archaeologists today would not understand the daily functions of Egyptian life during this transition period as they do today.
